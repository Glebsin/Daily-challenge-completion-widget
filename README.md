This widget is designed only for tracking the full streak of the daily challenge, so if you don't have a full streak but want to track your daily challenge completion this widget is not for you

**HOW TO USE:**

Launch widget.py or download executable in releases (**WARNING**: next to the executable file, a settings file widget_settings.json is created, it is better to open the executable file in a separate folder).

For statistics update you need create "New OAuth Application" here - https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit#oauth (as an example in the "Application Callback URLs" field you can specify `http://localhost:3456/`), then you need open widget settings (right click) and paste Client ID, Client Secret and username.

Use context menu on right click to change settings (scaling, always on top toggle, run at startup toggle, view update statistic time, exit).

Functions:

1. scaling from 100 to 500%
2. scaling and position save
3. sticking to the edge of the screen
4. always on top switch
5. precise movement of the widget by arrows
6. autostart
7. statistic update time

Todo:
1. theme customizing
